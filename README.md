# Scan2PDF

This is just a tiny script to help me create a PDF using a WIA-compatible scanner without using a bloated scanner application.

Due to the pandemic thing, I have to do open-book exams. That mean, among other things, send a written answer book to the platform. Using software provided by the scanner manufacturer is not good for time-sensitive jobs. So I create this script to reduce my panic during answer submission stage :/.

## Installation

Due to the usage of the WIA interface, only Windows is allowed.

And obviously, a scanner.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` should be enough.
